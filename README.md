# test-bare-workflow-pubnub-integration
Testing minimal expo bare workflow app integration with pubnub sdk

The main branch is after the install of pubnub and pubnub-react you can see it adds unimodules to the yarn.lock as expected due to pubnub's webcrypto dependency. 

The other branch shows before the pubnub install that the expo run:ios command is working.
